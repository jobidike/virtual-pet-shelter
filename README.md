Virtual Pet Shelter Project

In my model class of VirtualPet I started off with my instance variables: name, description, hunger, waste, boredom and thirst.
After that I created two sets of constructors. One set had the name and description, the other had name, description and the four activities.
Then I  made the accessor method(getters) for all the instance variables and the last thing on the page was the override for a toString.
